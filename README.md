# Built Values for Dart

Built values are value types for Dart.

They have generated `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString` and builder class.

This provides an easy way to write deeply immutable classes for Dart that
behave in a consistent, predicatable way.

See
[this example](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart/tree/master/example)
for a full project with a `build.dart` and some example value types.
