# Built JSON for Dart

## Introduction

Built JSON provides serialization for the
[Libraries for Object Oriented Dart](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart/blob/master/libraries_for_object_oriented_dart.md#libraries-for-object-oriented-dart).

This allows a complete serializable object oriented data model to built from
[Enum Classes](https://github.com/google/enum_class.dart#enum-classes-for-dart),
[Built Collections](https://github.com/google/built_collection.dart#built-collections-for-dart)
and
[Built Values](https://github.com/google/built_value.dart#built-values-for-dart).


## Examples

See
